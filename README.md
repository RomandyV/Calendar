# Calendar

For my first project of my CIS 162 (Computer Science I) class, I created functions for a calendar to learn the basics of Java.

# I learned about:
- How to create java files
- Different variable types and how to use them
- How to create methods (functions)
- If statements
- Switch Statements
- How to create tests
- The "this." statement
- Parsing Strings
- The Decimal Format class
- Creating comments
